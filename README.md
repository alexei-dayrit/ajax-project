## Why I built this project

I knew I wanted my first JavaScript, HTML, and CSS project to be some sort of game. I came across **The Open Trivia Database**, which immediately reminded me of a game my friends and I used to play in high school, *Trivia Crack*. I decided to recreate this trivia style game, but with simpler colors and design.
